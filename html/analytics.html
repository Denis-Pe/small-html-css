        <h4>Joy</h4>
        <p>All in all, I enjoyed writing this. Even in C given that the unsafety gives me a fun puzzle to deal with.
            Although I wouldn't like to write C if I can use Rust or Java or anything that won't allow me to make a
            bloody mess.
        </p>

        <h4>Interesting Notes</h4>
        <p>I timed all filters one after the other in order, and we could see how in Java the JIT compiler gives really significant gains, and I am not even sure whether I gave it enough time for it to start getting even more aggressive.</p>

        <p>And even though it was slower than Rust, I wonder how much smaller or bigger the gap becomes in a faster system.</p>
